          <h4>Why use cybersecurity toolbox?</h4>
          <p id="text">
            Cybersecurity tools at the enterprise level are important because they protect company and customer data from being stolen or leaked by hackers or computer viruses. They also protect the company's computer equipment, preventing it from being damaged or blocked by malware or ransomware. In addition, they protect the corporate image and customer confidence in the company, preventing it from being affected by possible security incidents or breaches of data protection regulations. They also protect the company's productivity, preventing time and money from being wasted in repairing the damage caused by cyber attacks or recovering lost information. Likewise, they protect the company's budget, preventing it from having to face fines or penalties for suffering security breaches or not having adequate cybersecurity measures in place. Finally, they protect the company's resilience, enabling it to quickly identify and respond to vulnerabilities and threats affecting its network infrastructure and connected devices.
