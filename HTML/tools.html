          <strong>Fluxion</strong>
          <p>
            Fluxion is a new tool for performing Wi-Fi wireless network audits.
            Fluxion works similarly to Wifite, it launches a social engineering
            attack and checks if the user of the attacked Wi-Fi network enters
            his network password and checks if the Wi-Fi password is correct or
            not.

            is a free to use, open source (GPL) web server scanner that performs
            a vulnerability scan on web servers for multiple items, including
            dangerous files and programs, and looks for outdated versions of web
            server software. It also checks for server configuration errors and
            possible vulnerabilities that may have been introduced.

          <strong>Nmap</strong>
          <p>
            Nmap is an open source port scanning program originally written by
            Gordon Lyon, better known by his alias Fyodor Vaskovich, and now
            developed by a community. It was originally created for Linux but is
            now cross-platform. It is used to evaluate the security of computer
            systems, as well as to discover services or servers on a computer
            network, for which Nmap sends defined packets to other computers and
            analyzes their responses.
